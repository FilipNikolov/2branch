    <p>In A Girl and a Gun: The Complete Guide to Film Noir, David N. Meyer says: "Though the plot may not make a whole
        lot of sense the first time around—and the thick European accents of a couple of the major actors doesn't
        help—The American Friend is worth the effort. Few movies from any era or genre offer such rich characters,
        realistic human relationships, gripping action sequences, or sly humor."In Out of the Past: Adventures in
        Film Noir, Barry Gifford writes, "Of all the 'homage' films made since the 1940s and '50s meant to evoke noir,
        The American Friend succeeds more than most because of the spaces, the sputters, and sudden shifts of energy
        that allow the characters to achieve veracity."</p>

    <p>The film was entered into the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. It has a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes
        based on 22 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.33/10. The Critics' Consensus reads, "The American Friend is a
        slow burning existential thriller that does justice to the Patricia Highsmith source novel.Roger Ebert gave
        the film three stars (out of four), writing: "[Wenders] challenges us to admit that we watch (and read)
        thrillers as much for atmosphere as for plot. And then he gives us so much atmosphere we're almost swimming in
        it. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews had a more mixed reaction, calling the film "occasionally thrilling"
        and praising "Ganz's subtle, thoroughly compelling performance" but criticizing what he called a "disastrous
        final half hour.</p>

    <p>Highsmith initially disliked the film but later changed her mind. Joan Schenkar's biography The Talented Miss
        Highsmith: The Secret Life and Serious Art of Patricia Highsmith quotes Wenders: "I was really happy with the
        picture and couldn't wait to have Patricia see it. But then, to my great disappointment, she was quite disturbed
        by it, didn't conceal that either and didn't have anything good to say about it after the screening. I left
        utterly frustrated. Months later, I got a letter from her. She said she had seen the film a second time, this
        time in a public screening on the Champs-Élysées during a visit in Paris. And she had much better feelings about
        it now. ... And she was full of praise for Dennis Hopper, too, whom she had flat-out rejected the first time.
        She now wrote that my film had captured the essence of that Ripley character better than any other films. You
        can guess how relieved I was! In a 1988 interview, Highsmith praised the film's "stylishness" and said the
        scenes on the train were "terrific."</p>
