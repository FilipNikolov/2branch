    <p>The Simpsons is an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_sitcom" target="_blank">animated
            sitcom</a> created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening" target="_blank">Matt
            Groening</a> for
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" target="_blank"> Fox Broadcasting
            Company</a>.
        The series is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire" target="_blank">satirical</a> depiction of
        American life, epitomized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_family" target="_blank">Simpson
            family</a>, which consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson" target="_blank">Homer
        </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_Simpson" target="_blank">Marge</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson" target="_blank">Bart</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson" target="_blank">Lisa</a>, and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Simpson" target="_blank">Maggie</a>.
        The show is set in the fictional town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_(The_Simpsons)"
            target="_blank">Springfield</a> and parodies <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States" target="_blank">American culture</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_United_States" target="_blank">society</a>, television,
        and the human condition.

        The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_shorts" target="_blank">animated shorts</a> with producer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Brooks" target="_blank">James L. Brooks</a>.
        He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for
        his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpleton" target="_blank">"simpleton"</a>.
        The shorts became a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" target="_blank">The
            Tracey Ullman Show </a> on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour
        prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989â€“1990).

        Since its debut on December 17, 1989, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_episodes"
